# Ultimate_Encoding_Fixer
A python script to open a folder, replaces all special characters in comments and save all files within it, with utf-8 encoding.
All special charaters replaced are from the portuguese language, feel free to change it. The comments in question are the C language comments (// or /**/).

In order to use it, simply place it in the folder you want do modify, and run it.
